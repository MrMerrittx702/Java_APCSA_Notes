/*
Java is a class based, object-oriented programming language
Developed by Sun Microsystems in 1995.
It is intended to be write once run anywhere(WORA). 
Java code is compiled into byte code, which is then interpreted by a Java Virtual Machine
This allows java to be run on all platforms that support java. 
Java code does not need to be recompiled to run on multiple platforms.
Java remains one of the most popular programming languages


Check if Java is installed on command prompt
C:\Users\YourName\java -version

every application begins with a class name, that must match the filename.
classes should always start with an uppercase letter. 
to compile to byte code > javac Main.java
to execute > java Main

         Errors will show up when coding
         There are 3 types of errors:
         Syntax errors: errors that are detected by the compiler due to incorrectly written syntax
         Runtime errors: errors that cause the program to crash unexpectedly
         Logic errors: errors that cause the program to operate other than intended.
         
         Common errors to think about:
         	Missing braces {}
         	Missing semicolon ;
         	Mising quotation mark ""
         	Misspelling names
