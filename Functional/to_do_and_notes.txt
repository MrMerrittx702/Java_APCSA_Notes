Functional programming Java TO DO and NOTES

The default int value is 0 so there is no "need" to initialize. But INITILIZE anyway. 

stay away from ternary operator on the test (noone uses them and it isn't impressive)

use variables over hard coded numbers(the AP test wont give you the values)

for-each loop is bad idea for FRQs but do show up in the MultipleChoice


for comparisons
x = 0 
if x == 0 

common error x = 0 gets by the compiler 
best practice is to reverse this if 0 == x 
from dad 
add to ifElse statements

how to declare unsigned values

talk about rounding with computers in Data Types
