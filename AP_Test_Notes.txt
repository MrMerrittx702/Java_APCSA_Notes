First Things First --> You only need about half the point to get a 3 on the AP exam.

Test is on paper so use paper for notes and sample problems( all FRQs should be on paper)

It is recommended that you spend as much time actually coding and solving problems as possible before the exam.

For the test do not worry about "pretty" code. Write your code so that it works and that is all that matters.

Important---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When answering FRQs work on A then work on B don't do both at the same time.

Steps for answering FRQs:
1 Read and understand the problem
2 Handle the return (write the return first and cross out if no return)
3 Write a to do list (algorithm)
4 Declare and initialize variables
5 Code
6 Reread check against examples(important)
  (These steps are as helpful in real world coding as much as they help on the test)

Steps for a class FRQ:
1 Read and understand the problem
2 Class heading. Does it extend another class? (implements? does not exist on the AP test and loses points)
3 Create private instance variables. (they must be private or you will lose points) assume private
4 Constructor(s) 
5 Other methods
6 Reread - Check agains the examples

When writing your code:
> start with variables 
> then input
> next calculations
> finally result

Helpful for earning better scores:
  Draw vertical lines between braces
  Neat handwriting and make sure to convey your intent clearly
  Don't comment your code in the exam
  -->Unless you pet the cat backwards then comment your code.(ask your teacher they will let you know if you pet the cat backwards)


Additional Notes:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What is the purpose of a constructor?
  Answer: constructors initialize instance variables 

"Unrelated methods" mean methods that do not call each other.
Always check for parameters

Check for null when working with an array of objects. You must have plan for null values.
  if(array[index] != null){
    array[index].method(); 
  }
  

Strings are immutable(cant change)

Keep track of the type of data 

The default int value is 0 so there is no "need" to initialize. But INITILIZE anyway. 

Stay away from ternary operator on the test (noone uses them and it isn't impressive)

Use variables over hard coded numbers(the AP test wont give you the values)

For-each loop is bad idea for FRQs but do show up in the MultipleChoice

Check for edge cases (division by 0 or null values)

if you have an array of objects always check for null.
if you do not it will throw an error and the AP test will count off. 

Students will lose points for using double equals to compare strings
  use the equals() method for objects instead.

Often part B in questions will call part A in FRQs.
  Whether you did part A correctly or not assume it works.

You cannot do math with objects.

For class design:
    Create private instance variables first then public methods

extends == IS-A relationship
composition == HAS-A relationship

if the child does not have the method it looks in the parent method
if the parent does not have the method it looks to the grandparent(object)

attributes are nearly always private
methods are nearly always public

Do not attempt recursion on FRQs(You are likely to mess up, and they rarely earn good scores for FRQs)

This question may appear. 
  If you are using a binary search algorithm and the array is 10000 indices long how many times will it loop?
    Solution: divide by 2 all the way to the end and count how many times you divided

The first line of a child constructor needs to be super(); super refers to the parent class.
  super().method can be used to call the methods of the parent class in a child class. 

An enhanced for loop (for-each loop) is all bad idea for FRQs but do show up in the MultipleChoice
