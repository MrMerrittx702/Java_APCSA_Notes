Notes:
Abstraction hides details
abstract keyword is a non-access modifiers used for classes and methods
abstract classes cannot be used to create objects and to access the class it must be inherited form another class
abstract methods can only be used in an abstract class, and it does not have a body. The body is provided by the subclass (inherited from).
